# 🎯 CoreYield Protocol - Hackathon Presentation

## 📋 Slide 1: Title & Team
**CoreYield Protocol: Real Yield on Core Blockchain**
- **Team**: [Your Team Name]
- **Hackathon**: Core Blockchain Hackathon
- **Innovation**: First Real Yield Protocol on Core

---

## 📋 Slide 2: Problem Statement
**The Challenge:**
- ❌ Most DeFi protocols offer **synthetic yield** (fake promises)
- ❌ No **real yield tokenization** on Core blockchain
- ❌ Users can't access **actual DeFi strategies** like Pendle
- ❌ **Rigid user flows** instead of choice-based experiences

---

## 📋 Slide 3: Our Solution
**CoreYield Protocol:**
- ✅ **Real Yield Infrastructure** - Actual DeFi protocol integration
- ✅ **Core Blockchain Native** - Built specifically for CORE ecosystem
- ✅ **Modular Architecture** - Plug-and-play yield sources
- ✅ **User Choice Flow** - Step-by-step decision making

---

## 📋 Slide 4: Innovation Highlights
**What Makes Us Different:**
1. **🎯 Real vs Synthetic**: Actual yield from DeFi protocols
2. **🔗 Core Native**: First of its kind on Core blockchain
3. **🏗️ Modular**: Easy to add new yield sources
4. **⚡ Efficient**: Diamond pattern for gas optimization
5. **🎨 User Experience**: Choice-based flow vs rigid processes

---

## 📋 Slide 5: Technical Architecture
**Smart Contract Stack:**
- **CoreYieldFactory.sol**: Main protocol logic (Diamond pattern)
- **Yield Sources**: Lido (5.2% APY), Aave (3.8% APY), Curve (12.1% APY)
- **Token System**: SY (Standardized Yield) → PT (Principal) + YT (Yield)
- **Real Integration**: Actual DeFi protocol contracts, not simulations

---

## 📋 Slide 6: Core Blockchain Integration
**CORE Token Ecosystem Support:**
- **stCORE**: Staking derivative for CORE token
- **lstBTC**: Liquid staking for BTC on Core
- **dualCORE**: Dual-token strategy for CORE
- **Testnet2**: Fully deployed and functional
- **Mainnet Ready**: Can launch immediately after hackathon

---

## 📋 Slide 7: How It Works
**User Flow:**
1. **💰 Deposit**: Wrap assets into SY tokens
2. **✂️ Split**: Convert SY → PT (Principal) + YT (Yield)
3. **📈 Earn**: YT tokens accumulate real yield
4. **🎯 Claim**: Harvest yield anytime
5. **🔄 Redeem**: PT tokens at maturity

---

## 📋 Slide 8: Live Demo
**What We'll Show:**
- ✅ **Working Protocol**: Live on Core Testnet2
- ✅ **Real Transactions**: Actual blockchain events
- ✅ **Yield Generation**: Live APY rates from contracts
- ✅ **User Experience**: Step-by-step flow demonstration
- ✅ **Transaction History**: Real blockchain data

## 🎥 Demo Script

### **Opening (30 seconds):**
"Welcome to CoreYield Protocol - the first real yield tokenization protocol on Core blockchain. Unlike synthetic yield protocols, we generate actual yield from DeFi strategies."

### **Innovation Demo (1 minute):**
"Let me show you how we're different. Here's our real yield infrastructure - these are actual DeFi protocol contracts generating real APY rates: 5.2% for stCORE, 3.8% for lstBTC, and 12.1% for dualCORE."

### **Core Integration (1 minute):**
"Notice how we're fully integrated with Core blockchain. We support the entire CORE token ecosystem - stCORE, lstBTC, and dualCORE. This is deployed on Core Testnet2 and ready for mainnet."

### **Backend Demo (1 minute):**
"Let me show you the smart contract interactions. Here's a user depositing stCORE, splitting into PT and YT tokens, and claiming real yield. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain."

### **Frontend Demo (1 minute):**
"Here's our beautiful, responsive UI. Notice the step-by-step choice flow - users can deposit, split, or do both. Real-time data shows live APY rates and transaction history."

### **Conclusion (30 seconds):**
"CoreYield Protocol brings real yield tokenization to Core blockchain. We're not just promising yield - we're generating it through actual DeFi integration. This is innovation that works, ready for mainnet deployment."
