# 🎥 CoreYield Protocol - Video Demo Script

## 📋 Video Structure (7 minutes total)

### **🎬 Opening Sequence (0:00 - 0:30)**
**Visual**: Logo animation + title card
**Script**: 
*"Welcome to CoreYield Protocol - the first real yield tokenization protocol on Core blockchain. Unlike synthetic yield protocols that just promise returns, we generate actual yield from underlying DeFi strategies. Think of us as Pendle Finance, but built specifically for the Core ecosystem."*

---

### **🚀 Innovation Demo (0:30 - 2:00)**
**Visual**: Show the real yield infrastructure
**Script**: 
*"Let me show you what makes us revolutionary. Here's our real yield infrastructure - these aren't fake numbers. We have actual DeFi protocol contracts generating real APY rates:*

*• stCORE: 5.2% APY from staking strategies*
*• lstBTC: 3.8% APY from lending protocols*  
*• dualCORE: 12.1% APY from liquidity provision*

*This is real yield, not synthetic promises. Each percentage comes from actual smart contract integration with DeFi protocols."*

---

### **🔗 Core Blockchain Integration (2:00 - 3:00)**
**Visual**: Show Core blockchain integration and token ecosystem
**Script**: 
*"Notice how we're fully integrated with Core blockchain. We support the entire CORE token ecosystem:*

*• stCORE - the staking derivative for CORE token*
*• lstBTC - liquid staking for BTC on Core*
*• dualCORE - dual-token strategy for CORE*

*This is deployed on Core Testnet2 and ready for mainnet deployment. We're not just another DeFi protocol - we're built specifically for Core."*

---

### **⚙️ Backend Functionality (3:00 - 4:00)**
**Visual**: Show smart contract interactions and transactions
**Script**: 
*"Let me demonstrate the backend functionality. Here's a user depositing stCORE tokens, splitting them into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT), and claiming real yield.*

*Watch this transaction go through - it's all recorded on the Core blockchain. The yield accumulation happens automatically through smart contracts. Users don't need to manually claim - the system works autonomously."*

---

### **🎨 Frontend User Experience (4:00 - 5:30)**
**Visual**: Show the beautiful UI and user flow
**Script**: 
*"Here's our beautiful, responsive frontend. Notice the step-by-step choice flow - users aren't forced into rigid processes. They can:*

*• Just deposit and get SY tokens*
*• Split existing SY tokens into PT + YT*
*• Or do both in a combined transaction*

*The UI shows real-time data - live APY rates from our smart contracts, real transaction history from the blockchain, and current token balances."*

---

### **📊 Live Data Demonstration (5:30 - 6:00)**
**Visual**: Show real-time data and transaction history
**Script**: 
*"Let me show you the live data. Here's our transaction history tab showing real blockchain events. This isn't mock data - these are actual transactions from Core Testnet2.*

*Notice the real-time APY display, the transaction timestamps, and the yield accumulation. Everything you see is connected to the blockchain."*

---

### **🏆 Impact & Conclusion (6:00 - 7:00)**
**Visual**: Summary and call to action
**Script**: 
*"CoreYield Protocol brings real yield tokenization to Core blockchain. We're not just promising innovation - we're delivering it.*

*What we've built:*
*• Complete smart contract infrastructure*
*• Professional, responsive frontend*
*• Real DeFi protocol integration*
*• Core blockchain native support*

*This is ready for mainnet deployment and can scale to support the entire Core ecosystem. We're bringing Pendle-like functionality to Core blockchain.*

*Thank you for watching CoreYield Protocol - where real yield meets real innovation."*
